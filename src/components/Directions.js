        "Meme was added to the dictionary in 2015!) a meme is a "an element of a
        culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from
        one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation a
        humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with
        slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users."{" "}
